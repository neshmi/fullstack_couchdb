# So, recapping...

1. CouchDB made OpenDig possible
2. Handles all replicationand synnchronizaiton for me
3. Map/Reduce was frustrating to learn and still feels somewhat clunky compared with MongoDB's quary language
4. BUT... the Map/Reduce + CouchDB's internal authentication system makes it possible to build an entire API within the database itself
5. CouchApps are really powerful, allowing you to make your app and database a single self-contained unit.
